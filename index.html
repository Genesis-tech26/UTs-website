            <div class="analysis-text">
                <p>New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac is promoted as the Philippines’ “city of the future.” It is marketed as a smart, green, world-class metropolis, designed to symbolize modern governance and national progress.</p>
                <p>However, behind this polished image lies a deep political, social, and environmental conflict. Large areas of farmland and ancestral domains have been converted into commercial, government, and sports facilities. Long-time residents, including Aeta communities, face displacement, loss of livelihood, and erosion of cultural identity.</p>
                <p>What appears to be progress for some has become a source of land dispossession and environmental disruption for others. This website examines tensions between national development, human rights, and environmental justice.</p>

            <div class="history-content">
                <p>New Clark City was conceptualized under the government’s Build Build Build program in 2016. The BCDA planned to transform over 9,000 hectares into a modern district with offices, sports centers, commercial hubs, and eco-friendly residential zones.</p>
                <p>Before the project began, these lands were home to farmers and Aeta communities who relied on agriculture, hunting, gathering, and cultural traditions.</p>
                <p>Construction cleared ancestral territories and farmlands, raising concerns about land ownership, cultural preservation, and displacement.</p>
